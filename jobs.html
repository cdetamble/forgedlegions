<p>Forged Legions aims to combine Warcraft 3 with Battle Brothers and depicts the player's warriors in the form of busts (helmet + head + body + weapon/shield) - no arms, no legs.</p>
<h3>Factions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Exiled criminals stranded on an island aiming to steal a legendary item from it. Each criminal has been exiled on the island for a different crime (examples: incinerator, thief, nymphomaniac, coinfaker). They have not so pretty faces, dirty clothes and skin, barbaric, untidy beards, viking-like, overgrown wildered haircuts, menacing aggressive faces.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Elfish nature faction trying to defend their home and preventing the other faction from stealing their holy item. They have spotless pretty faces, pale skinned, shaved faces (no beards), pretty eyes, tidy stylish haircuts, no pointy ears though :).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, it should be easily possible for the player to tell to which faction each characters belongs to by the character's looks.</p>
<h3>Required</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ability to model characters such that their faction/background story/motivation is reflected by their looks.</li>
<li>Ability to maximize visual quality while minimizing model complexity to keep the game performance high.</li>
<li>Consistent head dimensions so haircuts and beards are interchangable among the heads of both factions.</li>
<li>One half of a face is enough - the other half can be generated by a mirror modifier.</li>
<li>Modeling tool with Wavefront .obj export.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Workload "Criminal Faction"</h3>
<ul>
<li>5 female heads + 5 female haircuts</li>
<li>5 male heads + 5 male haircuts + 5 beards</li>
</ul>
<h3>Workload "Nature Faction"</h3>
<ul>
<li>5 female heads + 5 female haircuts</li>
<li>5 male heads + 5 male haircuts</li>
</ul>
<p>Example model files (.obj files) of heads, helmets and body will be provided as a base to start from and guidance for the right dimensions.</p>
